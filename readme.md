# üìñ Project Story: *Breaking Codes, Shaping History: The Women of Bletchley Park*

## ‚ú® What Inspired Me

While browsing through a documentary on World War II, I stumbled upon a fascinating segment about **Bletchley Park**, the top-secret headquarters where brilliant minds worked tirelessly to crack enemy codes. What struck me most was the **incredible yet often overlooked contributions of women** during this critical time. Names like **Joan Clarke** and **Mavis Batey** popped up, but I realized how little was popularly known about them.

That moment lit a spark in me ‚Äî I wanted to **create a space where these women‚Äôs stories could be told and celebrated**. And so, the idea of designing a website dedicated to the **women codebreakers of Bletchley Park** was born.

## üìö What I Learned

As I researched for this project, I uncovered so much about:

- **The importance of codebreaking in WWII** and how it shortened the war by an estimated two years.
- **The personal stories of women like Joan Clarke, Margaret Rock, and Mavis Batey**, who cracked codes and intercepted crucial enemy plans.
- How these women worked in secrecy, unable to tell even their families about the life-saving work they were doing.

It was both humbling and empowering to learn about **how intelligence, perseverance, and teamwork shaped history in silence.**

## üíª How I Built My Project

I built a **simple yet informative website** using **HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript** for interactivity. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

- **Homepage:** A welcoming title, designed on the basis of a cypher-reveal like text animation.
- **Biography Sections:** Dedicated profiles of notable women codebreakers with images and brief descriptions, but through horizontal scrolling.
- **Interactive Background:** An animated background that changes based on the user‚Äôs mouse movement, adding a touch of interactivity.

I kept the design clean and classic, with subtle colors reflecting the wartime era and vintage typewriter fonts for an authentic feel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges I Faced

Every project comes with its hurdles, and this one was no different:

- **Finding reliable resources:** It was tough to gather detailed, accurate accounts about the women at Bletchley, as many records were kept classified for years.
- **Balancing history with engagement:** I wanted to keep the website historically respectful but also interactive enough to interest young learners like myself.
- **Technical glitches:** Getting the title animation and animated background, along with gsap scrolling was a bit difficult that I thought.

## üåü Conclusion

This project wasn‚Äôt just a web design task ‚Äî it was a journey into a powerful, hidden chapter of history. It taught me **the value of storytelling through technology** and reminded me that **heroes come in all forms, often working quietly behind the scenes.**

I hope my website inspires others to learn about these remarkable women and realize that **history is full of untold stories waiting to be discovered**.
